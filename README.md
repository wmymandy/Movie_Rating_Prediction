# Movie Rating Prediction    

Nowadays, audiences can easily share their rating about a movie on the Internet. Movie rating
presents an objective basis for general audiences and advertisers to choose high quality movies and is also
an important factor to estimate final box office receipts. As a result, predicting the rating of a movie is
valuable to audiences, cinema, advertisers and investors.

In this project, we will predict the ratings of movies based on ratings that we found in Movielens
and the information available in IMDb and Wikipedia. Our prediction will be done based on two factors:
the specific types of movies such as drama, action, comedy, etc; the crew behind movies such as director,
actor, producer, etc. First, we will perform data preprocessing and integration on the datasets we found.
Then we will implement vector analysis using cosine similarity for the content based predicition. We will 
also use the collaborative filtering to predict the movie rating.
